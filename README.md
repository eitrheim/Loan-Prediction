# Loan Prediction

Preprocess the data (e.g. cleaning the formatting, dealing with missing data by dropping or imputing values, transformation of categorical variables, removing redundant information). Produced data visualization to understand the impact of independent variables (e.g. scatterplots, crosstabs (i.e. heatmaps), box plots, histograms). Used outlier analysis and feature engineering to augment the data preprocessing. Built regression models in Python to predict loan rates.

Methods used:
- Linear regression
- Decision trees
- Random forest
- XGBoost
- Cross validation
